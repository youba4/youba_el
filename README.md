Library Management System (Java Swing GUI)

A simple, ergonomic desktop application designed for university librarians to manage book collections and borrowing operations efficiently. This project was developed as part of the TP IHM (Human-Computer Interaction) module.

🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement a functional Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Java Swing, applying core principles of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to ensure a clear and user-friendly experience.

✨ Key Features

•
Main Dashboard: A centralized navigation hub with quick access to all system functions.

•
Book Management: Easily add new books to the library collection with details like Title, Author, and Publication Year.

•
Search Functionality: Quickly find books within the system using a flexible search interface.

•
Borrowing System: Manage book loans by linking books to borrower names, including real-time availability checks.

•
User Feedback: Integrated confirmation messages and error handling for a smooth user experience.

🛠️ Technical Stack

•
Language: Java

•
GUI Library: Java Swing

•
Architecture: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

•
Data Storage: In-memory storage using ArrayList (No database required)

📐 HCI Principles Applied

•
Clarity & Readability: Clean layouts with organized input fields.

•
Consistency: Uniform color schemes and button styles across all windows.

•
Error Handling: Validation for empty fields and invalid numeric inputs.

•
User-Friendly Interaction: Clear success/error messages via dialog boxes.

📂 Project Structure

•
Main.java: The entry point of the application and the main dashboard logic.

•
Book.java: Data model representing a library book.

•
Borrow.java: Data model representing a borrowing transaction.
